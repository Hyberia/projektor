3) Requirements
---------------

* Python 2.6
* C compiler (gcc)
* mkvtoolnix
* MPlayer with demuxer for you video files


5) Installation
---------------

Until there is a better way to install this setup, follow these instructions:

- Execute as root:
    ./install.sh
  It will build and install hyberiactl and readconfig then execute setup.py.

  This accepts the following arguments: install, uninstall, clean

  -install: This option is selected by default, and will build and install the application
  -uninstall: This will uninstall the application
  -clean: cleans the temporary files created during build

- Now run toueid and check if there is any error in the logs
  Just hit ctrl+c when you're done (toueid will send SIGTERM to mplayer and
  touei_run. touei_run does not output anything to the console. You should
  run a `tail -f` in the log file (default is /tmp/touei_main.log)

- Set whatever script you will use to monitor the status of toueid
  (The inittab is a good location).

- Enjoy

***** WARNING WARNING ******
THIS IS A EARLY RELEASE, WE ARE NOT RESPONSABLE IF YOUR MACHINE EXPLODES.
PLEASE BE AWARE THAT IT IS SOMEWHAT PRODUCTION READY.
We hope 0.4 will be stable enough for real deployment.

6) Configuration
----------------

Please see the touei.conf for the configuration instruction.

The default location is /etc/touei.conf. You can set a different path
in the touei_run file (located in /usr/local/bin) but it will break the
daemon. touei_run can also be run manually if you also start mplayer manually.

Log file are located in /tmp by default. Be aware that they are deleted at
reboot. You should change that behavior. I wanted to place them in /var
but a regular user doesn't have write access.
