4) Installation
---------------

** filename pattern **

First you need to rename your file according to a specific pattern:
* The first 4 characters are the time the video will be played in
  24 military hours format (4h00 PM = 1600).
  You time need to comply to a _modulus 5_. 1604 is not valid.

* A dot "."

* The name of the video. it will be used for the subtitling of the
  introduction video. It NEEDS to be unique.
  NO SPACE. Use underscore, they will be replace by space. Also, don't
  worry about the case, it will be `Title` for the intro video.

* The ".mkv" string for extension.

If you want to play "Higurashi no Naku Koro ni" at 3h45 PM the filename
will be:

- 1545.Higurashi_no_Naku_Koro_ni.mkv

** File structure **

The file structure is simple, inside the folder in the LOCATION config
entry you will need one folder for each day. If Sunday is the 3rd (of any
month) simple create a folder name "04" and put your files (named accordinly)
in that folder.
If the location does not exist, the script will die.
The script will also create the folder structure in the TMP-LOCATION.
If you are not sure what is the structure delete the TMP-LOCATION folder
and it will be recreated.

Since the default is in the /tmp you should worry to much, it is wipe
at each reboot. Just make sure there is enough space for the intro video.


5) Configuration
----------------

Please see the touei.conf.sample for the configuration instruction.

The default location is /etc/touei.conf. You can set a different path
in the touei_run file (located in /usr/local/bin) but it will break the
daemon.
