@TODO: Missing how to configure xorg and initrc
@TODO: add source for software

There is NO check if those program are installed. You should make sure they are.

4) Prerequisites
----------------

** filename pattern **

First you need to rename your file according to a specific pattern:
- The first 4 characters are the time the video will be played in
  24 military hours format (4h00 PM = 1600).
  You time need to comply to a _modulus 5_. 1604 is not valid.

- A dot "."

- The name of the video. it will be used for the subtitling of the
  introduction video. It NEEDS to be unique.
  NO SPACE. Use underscore, they will be replace by space. Also, don't
  worry about the case, it will be `Title` for the intro video.

- The ".mkv" string for extension.

If you want to play "Higurashi no Naku Koro ni" at 3h45 PM the filename
will be:

   1545.Higurashi_no_Naku_Koro_ni.mkv

** File structure **

The file structure is simple, inside the folder in the LOCATION config
entry you will need one folder for each day. The name of the folder is the
day of the month with a zero (aka 04 for the 4th of the month).
If the location does not exist, the script will die.
The script will also create the folder structure in the TMP-LOCATION.
If you are not sure what is the structure delete the TMP-LOCATION folder
and it will be recreated.

Since the default is in the /tmp you should worry to much, it is wipe
at each reboot. Just make sure there is enough space for the intro videos.


5) Installation
---------------

Until there is a better way to install this setup, follow these instructions:

- Execute:
    ./run_me.sh install
  It will build and install toueid and readconfig then execute setup.py.
  The first argument will be pass on.

- Now run toueid and check if there is any error in the logs
  Just hit ctrl+c when you're done (toueid will send SIGTERM to mplayer and
  touei_run. touei_run does not output anything to the console. You should
  run a `tail -f` in the log file (default is /tmp/touei_main.log)

- Set whatever script you will use to monitor the status of toueid
  (The inittab is a good location).

- Enjoy

***** WARNING WARNING ******
THIS IS A BETA, WE ARE NOT RESPONSABLE IF YOUR MACHINE EXPLODE.
PLEASE BE AWARE THAT IT IS NOT PRODUCTION READY.
We hope 0.2 will be.

6) Configuration
----------------

Please see the touei.conf.sample for the configuration instruction.

The default location is /etc/touei.conf. You can set a different path
in the touei_run file (located in /usr/local/bin) but it will break the
daemon. touei_run can also be run manually if you also start mplayer manually.

Log file are located in /tmp by default. Be aware that they are deleted at
reboot. You should change that behavior. I wanted to place them in /var
but a regular user doesn't have write access.
