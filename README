---------------

** filename pattern **

First you need to rename your file according to a specific pattern:
* The first 4 characters are the time the video will be played in
<<<<<<< TREE
  24 military hours format (4h00 PM = 1600).
=======
  24 hours format (4h00 PM = 1600).
>>>>>>> MERGE-SOURCE
  You time need to comply to a _modulus 5_. 1604 is not valid.
* A dot "."
* The name of the video. it will be used for the subtitling of the
  introduction video (and as a unique filename).
  NO SPACE. Use underscore, they will be replace by space.
* The ".mkv" string for extension.

if you want to play "Higurashi no Naku Koro ni" at 3h45 pm the filename
will be:
> 1545.Higurashi_no_Naku_Koro_ni.mkv
